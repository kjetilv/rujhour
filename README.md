# rujhour

A website written in noir. Apart from that, it's... well, not much more.  I'm just getting to grips with clojure,
so I backup my code here.  

I use enlive AND hiccup, and a netty-based ring adapter: https://github.com/shenfeng/async-ring-adapter

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```
